## Abstract
 Multiplication is a commonly used arithmetic operation; hence a multiplier is used in most digital systems like ALU of Microprocessor,  DSP applications such as image processing, and arithmetic related operation. A multiplier is a significant design that primarily uses full adders and half adders that consume a large portion of the area and power of the design. In this report, we have designed an 8×8 Dadda-Vedic tree multiplier with the advantage of the Dadda multiplier[1] by utilizing less full adder and half adder than conventional Wallace tree design[2] and also uses the advantage of the scalability of a Vedic multiplier. We have also presented an energy-efficient full adder[2] and a half adder that we are using in our design. We have used Synopsys custom compiler tool for the design using 28nm technology libraries.
